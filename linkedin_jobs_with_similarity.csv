My impact reaches across the team in which I work. I provide technical leadership of medium to large features, participating in their design and taking accountability for their delivery. I am comfortable implementing and shipping end-to-end stories and am starting to understand the deeper problems in my part of the business. I am likely to be considered an expert in a specific part of my domain. This is the first level at which I do more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the short-term and long-term goals across my product. I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade-offs. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

One’s mission is simple - to help customers achieve financial progress. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, borrow, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!

Job Description

My impact reaches across the team in which I work. I provide technical leadership of medium to large features, participating in their design and taking accountability for their delivery. I am comfortable implementing and shipping end-to-end stories and am starting to understand the deeper problems in my part of the business. I am likely to be considered an expert in a specific part of my domain. This is the first level at which I do more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the short-term and long-term goals across my product. I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade-offs.

At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team.

One’s mission is simple - to help customers achieve financial progress. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, borrow, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!

This is the first level at which I do more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the short-term and long-term goals across my product. I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade-offs. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Think Big, Act Fast

We have tremendous scope for innovation, but we will still be judged by impact over time. Big, bold ideas still need to be strategized against priorities, broken down, set in rapid motion, measure, refine, repeat. Great execution is what separates promising companies from proven unicorns.

Be Customer Obsessed

Everyone has the responsibility to drive towards the best experience for the customer, be an OSS user or a paid customer. If something is broken, own it, say something, do something; never ignore. Be the change that you want to see in the company.",,0

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.
